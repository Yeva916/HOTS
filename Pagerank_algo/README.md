# PageRank Algorithm Project
## Overview
This project is an implementation of the PageRank algorithm, a method used to rank web pages in search engine results. PageRank was developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were students at Stanford University. It assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the set.
